- 👋 Hi, I’m @sLoFiSec - aka Michael. Thank you for visiting my public github repository!

- ♿ Disability advocacy rights for individuals with neurological diversity and invisible disabilities is <3 -  Engineering hardware and administering infrastructure environments are my other joys. I enjoy playing video games and creating things with my hands, whether it be projects for work, or tinkering and organizing in my free time.

- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge and applied skillsets of github, terraform, chef, puppet, ruby on rails, and rhel. Preference is to continue growing and learning under AWS, Azure, and GCS - the go-to goal is SecDevOps / GRC from InfraIT side. Would consider Engineer or Collaboration Engineer positions in the Microsoft|Azure|AWS|GCS Multi-Cloud Tech Stack.

- 💪 My core strengths are in Microsoft, MacOS/iOS and Android/Google Hybrid-Cloud and Cloud Environments. I was a Microsoft System Administrator and HD/SD for 10+ Years, GCS 5+ Year, Azure 3 Years. I was on-site as a systems tech ii for over 7 years - and that provides my enhanced background in EUC Support and technical stacks. We officially DevOps now with finalized training!

- 🧠 Always learning and continuing to tinker with Dev and Prod Build Environments with Oracle's VirtualBox, via CentOS Stream, Arch Linux, and Red Hat Linux Enterprise Products. Also knocking off rust from GRC skills not used since 2019/2020 - and it feels good to be able to understand and build and tinker in my off time. 40-60 hours a week job searching, 25-30 hours a week of prof-dev to keep agile.
