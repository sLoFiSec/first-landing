- 👋 Hi, I’m @sLoFiSec - aka Michael. Thank you for visiting my public github repository!

- ♿ Disability advocacy rights for individuals with neurological diversity and invisible disabilities is <3 -  Engineering hardware and administering infrastructure environments are my other joys. I enjoy playing video games and creating things with my hands, whether it be projects for work, or tinkering and organizing in my free time.

- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge and applied skillsets of github, terraform, chef, puppet, ruby on rails, and rhel. Pref: continue growth and learning under AWS, Azure, and GCS banners, with Azure/AWS being main stack - the go-to goal is SecDevOps / GRC from InfraIT side. Multi-Cloud Tech Stack enviros preferred per Site Reliability Standards.

- 💪 My core strengths are in Microsoft, MacOS/iOS and Android/Google Hybrid-Cloud and Cloud Environments. I was a Microsoft System Administrator and HD/SD for 10+ Years, GCS 5+ Year, Azure 3 Years. I was on-site as a systems tech ii for over 7 years - and that provides my enhanced background in EUC Support and technical stacks. We officially DevOps with training and pratical application in containers and container accessories.

- 🧠 Always learning and continuing to tinker with Dev and Prod Build Environments with Oracle's VirtualBox, via CentOS Stream, Arch Linux, and Red Hat Linux Enterprise Products; feels good to be able to understand and build and tinker in my off time. 40-60 hours a week job searching, 25-30 hours a week of prof-dev to keep agile.
